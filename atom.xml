    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Twitter&rsquo;s role in the public sphere is a contradictory one. It is at once ubiquious – adorning all manner of billboards and signs, not to mention the lower fifth of the screen of cable news broadcasts – and yet almost entirely foreign to those who do not use it. That last clause verges on the tautological, but the emphasis is on <em>foreign</em>; I submit that Twitter is <em>bizarre</em> and outright <em>strange</em> to its non-users to a much greater extent than is true in the case of Facebook or just about any of the other prominent social web services.<!--more--></p>

<p>Although Twitter&rsquo;s ubiquity ensures that just about everyone has <em>heard</em> of it, and may even be aware that it has developed into a substantial forum for worldwide discourse, I get the sense that most people have never been shown a single, compelling reason why they might personally trouble to open an account.</p>

<p>As a devoted, adoring user of the service<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, this strikes me as a mild tragedy. It is understandable why many people might feel this way; bootstrapping an account from naught to useful is not an especially easy task, and is fraught with several meaningful obstacles:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Bootstrapping Problem</strong>: Twitter gets more interesting with each additional account you discover and follow<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. However, at the dawn of an account – with zero follows – Twitter&rsquo;s &lsquo;interestingness&rsquo; is at a minimum, as low as it will ever be. This is not encouraging to a newcomer.</li>
<li><strong>Utility</strong>: As a consequence, it is not at all clear to a newcomer what possible utility they might receive from this new account. Moreover, newcomers seem to believe that the primary purpose of Twitter is in <em>tweeting</em><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, when in actual fact, <em>reading the timeline</em> is the main reason it&rsquo;s worth having an account. To be sure, it&rsquo;s fun to participate in conversations once in a while, but one can receive an enormous amount of value from Twitter simply by following a set of interesting accounts, reading their updates, and perhaps never once sending a tweet.</li>
<li><strong>Esotericism</strong>: Twitter pioneered, or at least greatly popularized, several new dynamics such as the asymmetric follower/following relationship and <code>@</code>-mentioning. It also has its own conventions which are opaque from the outset<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. Although all of this is well understood by regular users, I get the impression it is intimidating to start with.</li>
</ul>


<p>Twitter has visibly attempted to address these issues<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>, though not satisfactorially, I would argue. The onboarding process addresses the bootstrapping problem to a degree, but that&rsquo;s only useful once a newcomer has been convinced to sign up. Prior to that point, Twitter has done a poor job communicating the message that, <strong>if you like reading stuff on the web, and most people do, after all; then you would almost certainly enjoy having a Twitter account</strong>.</p>

<p>That is exactly my position. I posit that the intersection of people who (a) currently like reading the internet and (b) would enjoy Twitter with a sufficiently-well-constructed following-list is one and the same.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re reading this, and don&rsquo;t have a Twitter account, I <em>implore</em> you to give it a try.</p>

<ol>
<li>Open an account. Using your real name or having the account be associated in any way with your real identity is strictly optional.</li>
<li>Pick some people to follow. See the end of this page for some suggestions.</li>
<li>Have a look at the timeline several times a day. It&rsquo;s not a corporate email inbox – to be doggedly read to completion, but rather, a river of interesting things for perusal and sampling at any time.</li>
</ol>


<p>With a judiciously selected follow-list, Twitter has the potential to become a fascinating window onto the world, tailored to your own interests. It is truly fantastic, and you should give it a try if you haven&rsquo;t already.</p>

<h3>Addendum: Some Follow Suggestions</h3>

    <link href="http://liggat.org/2014/06/30/why-publicly-forecast/"/>
    <updated>2014-06-30T18:10:31-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://liggat.org/2014/06/30/why-publicly-forecast</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research">Operations Research</a> training, I took a course in statistical forecasting. The course, despite being replete with interesting concepts and methods, had a fairly simple takeaway: more often than not, <em>forecasting is impossible</em>. This is particularly true in scenarios with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_(probability_theory)">martingale</a>-property such as stock prices.<!--more--></p>

<p>So it is with that in mind that I cannot help but be cynical when I see a prominent organization, usually a bank or investment house of some sort, publicly forecast financial figures such as currency exchange rates or stock prices.</p>

<p>Consider this statement, as reported by the CBC in January of 2014:</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canadian-dollar-headed-to-85-cents-us-td-says-1.2516849">Canadian dollar headed to 85 cents US, TD says</a></h4>

<blockquote><p>In the near-term, the loonie is forecast to fall as low as 85 cents U.S. by mid-year.</p></blockquote>

<p>Why do this? It is hard to ascribe intellectual honesty to such prognostication. For one thing, I&rsquo;m largely convinced by the [weak] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis">efficient-market hypothesis</a>, and thus don&rsquo;t believe it is actually <em>possible</em> to forecast the price of a currency six months out<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Furthermore, assuming one <em>could</em> perform this forecasting with better-than-chance accuracy &ndash; why share that secret with the world? That knowledge, guarded jealously and carefully executed upon, would lead to untold riches. It is therefore difficult to arrive at charitable reasons why an organization would make such a pronouncement<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>As it turns out, this particular &lsquo;mid-year&rsquo; forecast was dead wrong:</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canadian-dollar-nears-2014-high-against-u-s-greenback-1.2689863">Canadian dollar nears 2014 high against U.S. greenback</a></h4>

<blockquote><p>The Canadian dollar tested six-month highs Friday, but analysts say they don’t expect the loonie’s recent strength to be the new normal. The Canadian dollar rose almost three-tenths of a cent to close at 93.80 cents US Friday</p></blockquote>

<p>Interestingly, coverage of such forecasts never seem to hold the prognosticators to account. Although the banks involved in these two statements were different, I have never seen the CBC or other news organization publicly examine the historical record for such forecasts.</p>

<p>My take: forecasting is generally impossible. Stochastic, martingale forecasting <strong>is</strong> impossible. Don&rsquo;t believe anyone who claims otherwise.</p>
<div class="footnotes">
<hr/>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>Speaking very imprecisely: if the information existed in the present to do this forecasting, it would quickly be arbitraged away such that the advantage would disappear.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>TD happens to be the forecasting organization in this case, but this activity is by no means exclusive to them. It is very, very common to read all manner of financial forecasts by banks, analysis firms, etc.<a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

    <link href="http://liggat.org/2014/06/05/accounts-are-containers/"/>
    <updated>2014-06-05T14:19:57-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://liggat.org/2014/06/05/accounts-are-containers</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve found myself explaining to some friends and family members the precise difference between a regular (i.e. non-registered) account, an RRSP account, and a TFSA account. In particular, many Canadians hold the mistaken belief that these accounts are <em>products</em> &ndash; a thing that the bank creates and sells. This is incorrect &ndash; <strong>accounts are containers</strong>, into which the same assets (cash savings, stocks, etc) can be placed. The type of the container merely specifies how its gains are taxed, nothing more.<!--more--></p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://liggat.org/images/2014/containers.png" width="600" title="'Containers'" ></p>

<blockquote><p>The type of the container merely specifies how its gains are taxed, nothing more.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Non-registered</h3>

<p>A non-registered account is simply an ordinary container with no special tax treatment. It can hold cash savings, stocks, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds, etc. A vanilla savings account is one such example, but a stock trading account could qualify also. Any &lsquo;gains&rsquo; from the assets in this container are subject to taxation, though it&rsquo;s worth noting that the various types of &lsquo;gain&rsquo; (e.g. interest, Canadian dividends, foreign dividends, capital gains) are each handled in their own special way &ndash; this is where the unfortunate complexity of the tax code rears its head. Regardless, bottom line: <strong>you pay tax on any gains in a non-registered account</strong>.</p>

<h3>RRSP</h3>

<p>An RRSP account is a container designed with retirement needs in mind. Like the non-registered account, it may hold a variety of asset types. It is taxed in a notable manner: when you <em>contribute</em> money to this account, you actually receive a reduction in your tax-payable for the year, today<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. However, when you <em>withdraw</em> money, usually in retirement, that money is treated as if it were salary income &ndash; and taxed accordingly. In the meantime, the assets in the container grow <em>tax-free</em> through the usual means (interest, dividends, capital gains).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.michaeljamesonmoney.com/2014/03/cra-your-rrsp-partners-whether-you-want.html">Michael James</a> has documented an excellent way to think of this transaction: in exchange for a reduction in this year&rsquo;s taxes, you grant the <a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/menu-eng.html">CRA</a> an ownership stake in the future value of your RRSP container. This turns out to be a beneficial manoeuvre so long as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_rate#Marginal">marginal</a> tax rate on the contributed money is higher than the <em>[unknowable but presumably and hopefully lower]</em> marginal tax rate at retirement. Bottom line: <strong>in an RRSP, you get a reduction in taxes today in exchange for granting the CRA a stake in the container&rsquo;s eventual disbursements</strong>.</p>

<h3>TFSA</h3>

<p>A TFSA is a container whose gains (interest, dividends, capital gains, etc) are <strong>never subject to taxation</strong>. Because that&rsquo;s such an attractive proposition, the government only permits adult individuals to contribute $5000 per year<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Assuming wise and/or fortunate investing decisions<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, the TFSA has the potential to grow substantially over a multi-decade period, and will result in a container of assets which is not subject to any taxation. Bottom line: <strong>Any growth within a TFSA is never taxed but only a limited contribution per year is permitted</strong>.</p>

<h3>Which Should I Use?</h3>

<p>It can be complicated. There is a ton of nuance to the rules governing the above, and this is not financial advice. With these general frameworks in mind, the question for every individual to be asking themselves is: <em>&ldquo;given my tax and income situation and future plans and possible scenarios, which of these gives me the most advantage?&rdquo;</em>. Each of these has a possible role to play, though the TFSA in particular is an excellent vehicle for investing. The opportunity it represents should not be squandered, in my view.</p>

<h3>Who cares &ndash; this is boring!</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m somewhat sympathetic to that claim. However, ignorance in the basics of this topic is very, very costly &ndash; in missed tax-saving opportunities and in selecting highly-suboptimal financial products. The price for ignorance is <em>substantial</em> personal expense. It&rsquo;s well worth a cursory knowledge of how these containers work, and how they can be used to advance one&rsquo;s freedom, happiness and life goals – which is of course the primary underlying objective of any personal finance initiative.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[A Call for Modern Banking]]></title>
    <link href="http://liggat.org/2014/04/22/a-call-for-modern-banking/"/>
    <updated>2014-04-22T06:40:07-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://liggat.org/2014/04/22/a-call-for-modern-banking</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I can scarcely walk past a bus shelter without being shown a poster by one of the big-five Canadian banks invariably touting their extended branch hours, new location(s), or magnanimous decision to remain open on Sundays. Guess what? No one under 60 cares.<!--more--> Visiting a bank branch is unnecessary for the overwhelming majority of banking interactions, and most people only do so on exceedingly rare occasions and with substantial reluctance due to the trespass upon time and the general hassle that a visit represents<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>What I, and undoubtedly many others, <em>would</em> like to see, however, is <strong>modern online services</strong>. I&rsquo;m actually astonished that one of these banks has not thrown a bit more investment in this direction – or if they have – it&rsquo;s not at all externally apparent. Right off the top of my head I can produce a laundry list of substantial online enhancements that I&rsquo;d like to see a bank implement &ndash; I&rsquo;d switch all my business in a heartbeat to any bank who made even a modest subset of these changes. I bet I&rsquo;m not alone.</p>

<h3>My Wish List</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Two Factor Authentication</strong>. My <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/180744?hl=en">email</a>, my <a href="http://blog.evernote.com/blog/2013/10/04/two-step-verification-available-to-all-users/">digital archive</a>, my <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/help/363/en">cloud storage</a>, and my <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2013/getting-started-with-login-verification">Twitter</a> account all have two-factor authentication (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-step_verification">2FA</a>). Why doesn&rsquo;t my bank account? It&rsquo;s not like 2FA is an unfamiliar concept to either the banks or the populace &ndash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip_and_PIN">chip &amp; PIN</a> for debit and credit cards has been deployed in Canada for many years. It seriously astounds me that as I write this in 2014, this hasn&rsquo;t been rolled out on the web by any bank that I&rsquo;m aware of.</li>
<li><strong>Sensible Policies on Passwords</strong>. Canadian banks seem to have an odd philosophy on passwords. TD&rsquo;s iOS app does not appear to permit paste into password fields &ndash; needlessly hampering the usage of password managers like <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword/mac">1Password</a>. BMO mandates an alphanumeric password of <strong>precisely-six alphanumeric</strong> characters<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Why the artificial limitations? These measures are destructive, not augmentative, of online-security.</li>
<li><strong>Modern Web</strong>. The web has improved immeasurably over the past decade. With the scourge of Internet Explorer&rsquo;s worst transgressions behind us, and transformative technologies like responsive-design, web typography, CSS transforms, client-side JavaScript frameworks (i.e. <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a>) constantly entering the tech-zeitgeist &ndash; it&rsquo;s a golden age for the web<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. You&rsquo;d never know it though, based on the appearance of online banking. I&rsquo;d be happy as a start with even a bit of interface-enhancing JavaScript, which is curiously absent from banking web apps &ndash; virtually unthinkable in 2014 in most other online contexts. Instead, absurdly high page latencies, an absence of responsive-design and stodgy <em>Times-New-Arial</em> typefaces<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> are the order of the day.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile apps</strong>. Curiously, most Canadian banks do have mobile apps, on iOS at least, and yet they don&rsquo;t seem to serve any real purpose beyond marketing. Utility wise, there&rsquo;s no point having a mobile app that&rsquo;s nothing but a native container for [in their case, tremendously-slow-to-render] web content. With the exception of the Tangerine<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> app&rsquo;s ability to photo-deposit cheques – a welcome, if belated arrival – none of these apps actually enable any use-case that couldn&rsquo;t be accomplished in a mobile browser. I&rsquo;d like to see authentication caching, some use of native UI components perhaps, and a robust, configurable push notification scheme for transaction/payment alerts. And, of course, their possible use as a vehicle for the aforementioned 2FA.</li>
<li><strong>Data</strong>. I want access to my data. No, not as some Quicken <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_large_object">blob</a> or a poorly-formatted CSV file, but in a sane, structured format, preferably <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Json">JSON</a><sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>. It remains an utter hassle to view and use historical banking data &ndash; to find a particular subset of recurring transactions for example. Better structured banking data would enable entire classes of tools, workflows, and even businesses to exist.</li>
<li><strong>API/OAuth</strong>. Relatedly, I want a programmatic method to access this data, and support for an authorization technique like OAuth to delegate <strong>revocable</strong> access to a trusted third party. This is a well-solved problem &ndash; it is a ubiquitous pattern in tech, and there is enormous demand for it to exist. Since it doesn&rsquo;t exist &ndash; horrible kludges like providing aggregation sites (e.g. <a href="https://www.mint.com/">Mint</a><sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>) banking credentials are the only way to enable third-party access.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Objections</h3>

<p>I bear no illusions that a CTO or similar executive from one of these banks will even see this, much less take it seriously. Even if they did see it, I can imagine the guffaws about how unrealistic this nerd&rsquo;s demands are:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t justify the cost of a massive online systems redesign!&rdquo;</em></li>
<li><em>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know how complex our legacy backend is &ndash; our password policy was chosen to support that!&rdquo;</em></li>
<li><em>&ldquo;We have a myriad of customers and browsers to support &ndash; not everyone is running Safari on brand-new MacBook Pros you know!&rdquo;</em></li>
<li><em>&ldquo;The regulations we are under would never permit API access! We can&rsquo;t ever permit customer data to go to &lsquo;third parties&rsquo; &ndash; the banking regulators and the newspapers would have a field day!&rdquo;</em></li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;m absolutely aware that what I&rsquo;m suggesting requires investment, that banks operate under strict regulation, that data integrity is critical in the financial system (i.e. so technological conservatism is desired). I&rsquo;m further aware that the user base is indeed large, of a wide spectrum of technical-comfort, and that the user-age-distribution is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness">negatively-skewed</a><sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>.</p>

<p>So, sure – there are obstacles. But this stuff is hard to get right, not just the tech but also the product vision that goes along with it. With each passing year, the gap between online-banking and the rest of the modern web grows ever starker. I see no reason why the tech we use everyday in virtually every other aspect of life should rocket ahead in functionality, design, thoughtfulness, integration, etc &ndash; while finance/banking remains virtually the same today as in 2004.</p>

<p>If nothing else, I believe excellence in these areas will become a competitive advantage sooner than banks apparently seem to think. Does anyone really think that in ten years time, the major customer service innovation to be touted from every bus-bench will still involve the local branch in some way?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last summer, my better half and I spent some time in Scotland, the country of my birth. Departing from Edinburgh, and en route to Inverness, we went through Glencoe in the Scottish Highlands. Leaving aside the very real potential for bias on my part &ndash; Glencoe is a hauntingly beautiful place, with equally impactful history in its past.<!--more--></p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://liggat.org/images/2014/glencoe.jpg" width="500" title="'Glencoe'" ></p>

<p>George R.R. Martin is <a href="http://www.nerdist.com/2013/06/george-r-r-martin-explains-the-red-weddings-historical-roots/">well known</a> to have drawn inspiration for <strong>A Song of Ice and Fire</strong><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> from aspects of this part of the world. Famously, the highly-significant and series-defining <em>Red Wedding</em><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> event parallels the heinous circumstances of the late-seventeenth century <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre_of_Glencoe">Massacre of Glencoe</a>. Moreover, further North in Scotland is a region known as <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/wester+ross/@57.7018103,-5.6741077,11z">Wester Ross</a> &ndash; which bears more than a passing linguistic similarity to <em>Westeros</em>.</p>

<p>With the fourth season of <strong>Game of Thrones</strong> underway today on HBO, this is a fairly relevant time to document my theory about the original series title; i.e. why is <strong>A Song of Ice and Fire</strong> named thusly?</p>

<p>Back in 2013, in Glencoe, our tour bus stopped at a small vantage point. An educational plaque–the sort you imagine gets put in place by a local historical society and promptly forgotten–was at the head of the vantage point and explained some of the local geology. Interestingly, in one corner of the plaque was the phrase <strong>&ldquo;Of Fire &hellip; and Ice&rdquo;</strong>: used inconspicuously as a section header for a paragraph about geological time:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://liggat.org/images/2014/sign.jpg" width="500" title="'The Plaque'" ></p>

<p>I have no idea if George R.R. Martin has ever spoken publicly about the origin of the series title. I have no idea if he&rsquo;s seen this plaque, and even if he has, whether he remembers it or not. But he clearly has a connection to the area, and it seems plausible to me that this little detail on this unassuming plaque, whether consciously or otherwise, somehow became the core of the title of his magnum opus.</p>

<p><strong>A Song of Ice and Fire</strong> is, of course, the name of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire">series</a> of books for which <strong>A Game of Thrones</strong> is book one.

    <updated>2014-03-23T12:55:48-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://liggat.org/2014/03/23/ipv6-an-unreachable-wall</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="http://www.fiatlux.fm/pragmatic/16">episode 16</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/fiatluxfm">Ben Alexander</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/johnchidgey">John Chidgey&rsquo;s</a> excellent <a href="http://www.fiatlux.fm/pragmatic/">Pragmatic</a> podcast, the hosts touched upon the unfortunate tendency of organizations &amp; individuals to underanticipate the scale of future demands upon their designed technology.<!--more--></p>

<p>Examples of this phenomenon abound:</p>

<ul>
<li>The North American <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_switched_telephone_network">PSTN</a> seemed like a vast address space at the time of its inception, and yet I&rsquo;ve been through <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/vancouver-gets-10-digit-dialing-1.275934">at least one</a> extension in my life, as fax machines and mobile phones consumed far more telephone numbers than was anticipated.</li>
<li>&ldquo;<em>640k [of computer memory] ought to be enough for anybody</em>&rdquo; &ndash; as famously attributed to Bill Gates<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</li>
<li>The ubiquitous Intel x86<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> CPU architecture use 32-bits for addressing locations in system memory; this imposes a hard theoretical 4GiB limit on memory size, which is meager by 2014 standards.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4">IPv4</a>, which uses <strong>32-bits</strong> to assign IP addresses (e.g. of the form <code>123.255.123.255</code>) to devices on the public Internet is insufficiently large of an address space to accommodate all future computing devices, and the world will need to transition<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6">IPv6</a> at some point.</li>
</ul>


<p>At some point, progress causes us to run into the limits imposed by these upper boundaries. John referred to this phenomenon as &ldquo;hitting the wall&rdquo;, and casted it as an inevitability for any technology.</p>

<p>I agree wholeheartedly, but one with one caveat. I know that history (and John Chidgey) are not on my side here<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, but I&rsquo;m going to go on record with the following postulate: once we finally switch to it, <strong>IPv6 will be an unreachable wall; i.e. it will be sufficient indefinitely as an address space for Internet routing</strong>. That is to say &ndash; a limit exists, but humanity won&rsquo;t be able to reach it.</p>

<h3>IPv4</h3>

<p>My argument for this is strictly numerical. IPv4 uses 32-bits to uniquely identify devices<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> on the public Internet. TCP/IP was birthed into a world of expensive, rare mainframes &ndash; computers and Internet connections were scarce. Four billion unique IPs (i.e. <strong>2<sup>32</sup> = 4,294,967,296</strong>) must have seemed vastly beyond sufficient at the time. Yet as I write this in early 2014, it&rsquo;s worth noting that China alone has <a href="http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2014/3/12/700m-smartphones-tablets-in-china">700 million</a> active smartphones and tablets, most of which consume a IPv4 address. We&rsquo;re hitting the wall.</p>

<h3>IPv6</h3>

<p>IPv6, by contrast, skips over 64 bits and uses 128-bits for addressing. This yields <strong>2<sup>128</sup></strong> possible addresses: an unfathomably huge number. <strong>2<sup>128</sup></strong> written <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2%5E128">in full</a> has thirty-nine decimal digits, or can be abbreviated as <em>340 billion billion billion billion</em>, if you prefer.</p>

<p>While I have great faith in the ability of humanity to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">squander</a> a seemingly-endless resource, it is worth reflecting on the sheer scale of this number. The surface area of the Earth is <strong>510,072,000 km<sup>2</sup></strong>, or, less usefully, <strong>5.101 × 10<sup>20</sup> square-millimeters</strong>. <strong>2<sup>128</sup></strong> is so large that each square millimeter of area on the Earth&rsquo;s surface could <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2%5E128+%2F+5.101e20">support</a> <strong>667,000,000,000,000,000</strong> unique IPv6 addresses! Not in aggregate &ndash; that number of addresses exists for <em>each and every</em> square millimeter on the Earth, ocean and land alike!</p>

<p>Of course, in practice the IPv6 address space will likely not be allocated cleanly &ndash; various countries and corporations will likely receive an undeservedly large allocation; blocks may sit unused and reserved, etc. But it seems to me that no matter how poorly IPv6 is stewarded &ndash; its massive, planetary scale allows for truly indefinite room to grow. With IPv6<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> the wall seems, to me, to be unreachable with certainty.</p>

<p><em>(It will be especially interesting for me to read this in a decade or two.)</em></p>

    <updated>2014-03-20T18:11:09-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://liggat.org/2014/03/20/a-robust-photo-workflow</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With the proliferation of smartphones, most people now have an excellent camera with them at all times, and are taking many more photographs per year than ever before.<!--more--></p>

<p>However, the current state of photo management on contemporary desktop and mobile operating systems is, frankly, abysmal. Apple, previously the standards-bearer in this arena through the mid-2000s with their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9046oXrm7f8">digital hub</a> strategy, seems to have lost interest in maintaining iPhoto and Aperture as serious photo asset management tools<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Adobe Lightroom is expensive, complex and unnecessary for most non-professional purposes. Everpix, sadly, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/5/5039216/everpix-life-and-death-inside-the-worlds-best-photo-startup">failed</a> to build a business around photo management.</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>So what&rsquo;s the answer? I wanted a way to manage my past and future photos with the following characteristics:</p>

<ol>
<li>Every photo in my collection (over 10,000 and counting since 2003), and every photo I take from now on, should be preserved by default in an archive with its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata">metadata</a> intact.</li>
<li>This archive should have a robust local and offsite backup strategy &ndash; photographs are irreplaceable, and their value to the creator increases with time.</li>
<li>This archive should be as futureproof as possible &ndash; I want to be able to view my photos at any point in the future regardless of device, machine migration, etc.</li>
<li>I should have the ability to view any photo in my collection from a mobile device, i.e. my iPhone or iPad, without having it cached locally.</li>
<li>It should be painless and hassle-free to add new photos into the archive, and thus the backup process.</li>
</ol>


<p>Inspired by <a href="http://www.macstories.net/tutorials/my-photo-management-workflow-early-2014/">Federico Viticci</a>, I&rsquo;ve migrated my photo library to a new system and ongoing process that works really well for me.</p>

<h3>iPhoto => Files &amp; Directories</h3>

<p>Requirement 3, at a stroke, entirely disqualifies database-based applications<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> like iPhoto. As my accumulated photo library was sitting in the increasingly-creaky iPhoto, the first step was to export the original <code>.jpg</code> files. The archive is therefore maintained as a set of files and directories going forward, and is thus highly future-proof.</p>

<p>The single most critical piece of metadata about a photograph is its creation date. Without this, it is inordinately difficult to find a particular photo, or preserve a sense of the original chronology of a series.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, file system metadata is insufficient as a repository for this signal. Machine migrations, underlying file system changes, and general <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_rot">bit rot</a> conspire to render this inadequate and fragile. Therefore, it makes sense to encode a photograph&rsquo;s creation date, available in the exif data, right inside its filename.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/">Exiftool</a>, available in <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew for OS X</a> is a great way to achieve this. After exporting from iPhoto, I was able to rename each file:</p>

<pre><code>exiftool "-FileName&lt;CreateDate" -d "%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S%%-c.%%le" export
</code></pre>

<h3>Binning the Files</h3>

<p>The above operation resulted in a directory with 10,000 <code>.jpg</code> files with an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iso8601#General_principles">ISO8601</a>-like filename, e.g.: <code>2011-02-03_16-12-11.jpg</code>. A bit unwieldy, but chronological and consistent. The next step was to separate these files by month, which I accomplished with a simple bit of Ruby (original on <a href="https://gist.github.com/dliggat/9677631">GitHub</a>):</p>

<h3>Storage, Backup, Viewing</h3>

<p>I decided that the best place to actually store this [so-far] 55GB archive was on Google Drive. This has a few benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cheap</strong>: At $2 per month for 100GB of storage as of the <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.ca/2014/03/save-more-with-google-drive.html">recent price drop</a>, it&rsquo;s hard to argue with the price.</li>
<li><strong>Local and Offsite Backup</strong>: These files live locally in <code>~/GoogleDrive</code> and therefore get subsumed into my wireless home network backups, but also have a disaster-mitigating copy on the cloud.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile Viewing</strong>: The iOS Google Drive app has quietly become a really high-quality piece of iOS software. It&rsquo;s a capable photo viewing app, and easily satisfies the mobile-viewing requirement (though I&rsquo;d like to see <a href="http://unboundapp.com/">Unbound</a> support it eventually also).</li>
</ul>


<p><img class="center" src="http://liggat.org/images/2014/gd.png" width="600" title="'Google Drive'" ></p>

<h3>Dealing with New Photos</h3>

<p>All of this so far covers requirements 1 through 4 splendidly. However, it&rsquo;s all a bit pointless if new photos aren&rsquo;t subsumed into this system on a hassle-free, ongoing basis. The final puzzle piece is also the most convoluted, but so far it seems to be holding up nicely:</p>

<ol>
<li>Take advantage of Dropbox&rsquo;s Camera Upload<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> functionality to send new photos over WiFi from my iPhone to the <code>~/Dropbox/Camera Uploads</code> directory on my Mac. This will happen in the background occasionally without any intervention from me, or I can trigger it manually whenever I want. Of course, <code>.jpg</code> files from other cameras can be placed here also<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</li>
<li>Use <a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel">Hazel</a> to watch that directory and segregate iOS screenshots (no need to archive those) and videos (I&rsquo;m still deciding how they should be handled), and then rename all <code>.jpg</code> files to the ISO8601-style format above. In this case, given the recency, it is reasonable to rely on the file metadata to encode the creation date in the filename.</li>
<li>Again with Hazel watching that directory, send those renamed files to <code>~/GoogleDrive/Photos</code>.</li>
<li>Another Hazel rule watching <code>~/GoogleDrive/Photos</code> will &ldquo;sort into subfolders&rdquo; and place each file into its appropriate year-month directory (e.g. <code>2014-03-Mar</code>), creating that directory if necessary.</li>
</ol>


<p><img class="center" src="http://liggat.org/images/2014/hazel.png" width="600" title="'Hazel'" ></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it! The archive is consistent, future-proof, viewable and has a strong backup-strategy &ndash; and all new photos from now on have a frictionless pathway into it.</p>

<p>While I&rsquo;m happy with this system for me (and eventually I&rsquo;ll roll it out to my family) Apple, Google, Microsoft, et al really need to solve this problem for their customers. Photos are precious, and people, as a rule, are far worse at ensuring the longevity of bits than paper.</p>

<p>They were never very good, anyway.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

<p>It is generally a bad idea to rely on these type of programs if you care about accessing your data in the distant future. It will likely be difficult, or at best inconvenient, to read a circa-2014 iPhoto library in 2024. I make an <a href="http://liggat.org/2013/07/21/paperless/">exception</a> in the case of Evernote.<a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:3">
<p>Ideally I wouldn&rsquo;t be relying on two separate cloud-storage providers, but the combination of Google Drive pricing and Dropbox functionality is compelling. Future changes will be easy, anyhow, depending on how the storage market evolves.<a href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

<p>So far this doesn&rsquo;t really apply, as the only camera I use is my iPhone 5s. I hung up my SLR a few years ago.<a href="#fnref:4" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

<li>In one browser, I opened <strong>@dliggat</strong> to <a href="https://twitter.com/settings/account">https://twitter.com/settings/account</a></li>
<li>In a seperate browser (Chrome instead of Safari in my case, but a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_mode">private browser</a> session would work also) I also opened <strong>@liggs</strong> to <a href="https://twitter.com/settings/account">https://twitter.com/settings/account</a></li>
<li>I renamed <strong>@dliggat</strong> to <em>@dliggattemp</em>. Once this is confirmed, the next two steps need to be completed as quickly as possible.</li>
<li>I renamed <strong>@liggs</strong> to <strong>@dliggat</strong>.</li>
<li>I renamed <em>@dliggattemp</em> to <strong>@liggs</strong>.</li>
</ol>


<p>It all worked out without a hitch. <a href="https://twitter.com/dliggat">@dliggat</a> it is from now on.</p>

    <updated>2014-02-16T07:21:59-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://liggat.org/2014/02/16/taking-a-stand-with-work</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Being a so-called <em>knowledge worker</em> comes with at least one very substantial downside: there is a fundamental lack of physical activity built into the job<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and long sedentary periods are commonplace. I&rsquo;ve been very cognizant of this for a long time, and do my best to actively combat it with daily exercise, gym routines, etc. While those help substantially, they do not alter the basic reality that one tends to be sitting in a chair for many hours, staring at a screen.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>To make matters worse, there appears to be <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/magazine/mag-17sitting-t.html?_r=0">growing evidence</a> that excessive sitting is pathological all on its own:</p>

<blockquote><p>Sitting, it would seem, is an independent pathology. Being sedentary for nine hours a day at the office is bad for your health whether you go home and watch television afterward or hit the gym. It is bad whether you are morbidly obese or marathon-runner thin. “Excessive sitting,” Dr. Levine says, “is a lethal activity.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Whether or not that hypothesis is even true &ndash; inherently it simply doesn&rsquo;t <em>feel</em> good to sit this much<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Two weeks ago, I decided to switch to a standing desk, and I don&rsquo;t think I will ever look back.</p>

<h3>The Trial Run</h3>

<p>A purpose-built <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/the-best-standing-desks/">standing desk</a> will run you around $1,000, or more. These high end models tend to be motorized and can memorize different configurations &ndash; so you can mode-switch between the ideal standing height and the ideal sitting height. While that sounds great, and while the cost can be easily justified on both amortization as well as &lsquo;mattress logic&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> grounds &ndash; it&rsquo;s a lot of money to drop without even knowing if it&rsquo;s a good fit. Enter, the trial run.</p>

<p>Via <a href="http://chambersdaily.com/bradleychambers/2013/11/21/building-a-standing-desk-on-the-cheap">Bradley Chambers</a>, I found <a href="http://iamnotaprogrammer.com/Ikea-Standing-desk-for-22-dollars.html">Colin Nederkoorn&rsquo;s</a> instructions for building a standing desk with $22 USD ($30 CAD up here) worth of Ikea parts. I ordered these same parts and followed Colin&rsquo;s directions to build the basic framework that sits on top of my existing desk. The result:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://liggat.org/images/2014/desk.jpg" width="500" title="'Homemade Standing Desk'" ></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not the most attractive thing in the world, and does not permit a quick mode-switch between sitting and standing &ndash; but it&rsquo;s hard to argue with the cost of entry as a way to trial the experience of a standing-desk.</p>

<h3>The Result</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve used this now for two weeks. Without exaggeration, I cannot ever see myself going back to a standard desk arrangement. The first couple of days were a bit more tiring than usual, as my body adjusted to the change. A few days later, it feels completely natural. Quite apart from the physical benefit of standing versus sitting, I&rsquo;ve found that standing imparts a greater sense of purpose to my current task: as if I&rsquo;m subconsciously striving towards completion before fatigue can arrive.</p>

<p>In practice, I don&rsquo;t actually stand the whole day &ndash; perhaps only 75%. I have meals sitting down of course, and take a few short sitting breaks during the day &ndash; usually at periods of planning or design. This has the secondary benefit of taking me away from the keyboard to exclusively focus on design itself.</p>

<p>In the medium-term timeframe, I&rsquo;ll almost certainly switch to a &lsquo;real&rsquo; standing desk. For now, this is a great way to work.</p>

<h3>Social Norms?</h3>

<p>I work from home and have the luxury of arranging my own workspace. I could work from an inflatable rubber-dinghy if I so chose, and there would be nothing stopping me from doing so.</p>

<p>Most people are not this lucky. They work at the desk and chair that their employer provides, and it would be frankly odd to be the lone oddball standing beside the Ikea contraption<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, as everyone else hunches over their desk. I can only hope that the dual forces of sitting-health-research, and remote-work-acceptance will drive us all towards more flexible, personal ergonomic arrangements.</p>

    <link href="http://liggat.org/2014/01/30/navigating-canadian-cellular-number-portability/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-30T19:47:12-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://liggat.org/2014/01/30/navigating-canadian-cellular-number-portability</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since 2007, Canadians have been afforded the right to migrate (&lsquo;port&rsquo;) their cellular <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pstn">PSTN</a> number with them when they switch to a new cellular operator. The legislation which enacted this brought to bear a small reduction in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switching_barriers">switching costs</a> in a &lsquo;market&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> widely reputed for hostility towards its customers, not to mention, [at the very least] <em>perceived</em> collusion among the operators themselves.<!--more--></p>

<p>Unfortunately, no matter which head of the <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=robelus">tripartite Cerberus</a> one ends up dealing with, this is far more hassle, and potentially more expensive, than it needs to be.</p>

<p>Cellular services are paid for one month in advance, and when you initiate a port, <em>no matter when you initiate it</em>, your current operator will attempt to bill you for one final advance month. The rationale, they say, is that they need thirty days of notice. This would be semi-reasonable if there were some official way to give that notice ahead of time. There isn&rsquo;t. The only way, in their view, to give that notice is through the port itself. So you&rsquo;re stuck paying for a month of service that cannot actually be delivered.</p>

<p>Let me repeat that: they demand thirty days of notice, but won&rsquo;t let you provide it in any way other than that which results in receiving a bill for an unnecessary month of undeliverable service. This is, obviously, bullshit. Here&rsquo;s how to get around it<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ensure your contract is over, and you don&rsquo;t owe an early-termination fee for the device subsidy you likely received two or three years ago. e.g. if you signed up on <code>2010-03-13</code> with a three year contract, by <code>2013-03-14</code> you&rsquo;re definitely in the clear.</li>
<li>Work out your billing cycle. This may or may not be explicitly stated on your invoice, but it generally covers your invoice date (e.g. the 15th of the month) plus 30 days.</li>
<li>Two days before your invoice date (e.g. April 13th), phone your operator and tell them you are intending to cancel. You&rsquo;ll probably need to sit through a barrage of retention offers. <strong>It&rsquo;s important that they don&rsquo;t actually cancel right then</strong> &ndash; you may lose the service and number. Tell the retention agent that you intend to cancel, but that you will phone back if you wish to accept the retention offer. Record the agent&rsquo;s name, call reference number, and the current date/time.</li>
<li>Use your phone as normal for another month.</li>
<li>Again two days before your invoice date (e.g. now May 13th) sign up for service with your new operator (hopefully a better deal than your current one) and have them initiate a port of the number.</li>
<li>Your previous operator will receive notice of the cancellation, and will issue a final bill covering any overage plus service from May 15th plus 30 days. This is the service they cannot actually provide, yet still bill for.</li>
<li>Now the real fun begins: phone the original operator to complain about the bill for undeliverable service. They will tell you that they require thirty days of notice for cancellations. Mention your &lsquo;notice&rsquo; call &ndash; done a month ago in step (3). They will say it doesn&rsquo;t count. Escalate to a manager. Patiently explain that the company is billing for something that it cannot possibly provide (the number is gone). Prepare to be the recipient of a deeply-flawed, logically-inconsistent argument about why it makes sense to be billed for this. End the call in despair, but again, ensure to record the agent&rsquo;s name, call reference number, and the current date/time.</li>
<li>Visit the <a href="https://www.ccts-cprst.ca/en/complaints/complaint-form">CCTS</a> (the Commissioner for Complaints for Telecommunications Services). Create a new complaint. Explain the timeline<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> of events, and be sure to mention the particular timestamps and call reference numbers.</li>
</ol>


<p>In a few days time &ndash; expect to receive an incredibly cordial and understanding call from the operator&rsquo;s Office of the President or similar Ombudsman-type department. This person will explain that the other agents were mistaken, and that you are in the right. They will happily nullify the &lsquo;erroneous&rsquo; charge and graciously thank you for your time.</p>

<p>This is <strong>nuts</strong> of course &ndash; but this elaborate dance is what&rsquo;s required of you if you want to port without paying for two sets of service for a month. One could be forgiven for believing this was an isolated incident, <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=rogers+port+ccts&amp;oq=rogers+port+ccts">but it definitely isn&rsquo;t</a>. Hell &ndash; I learned how to do all this by piecing it together from other anecdotes online.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no panacea to fixing telecom in Canada<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, but I&rsquo;m happy to accept small victories where I can.</p>

    <updated>2014-01-15T14:23:19-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://liggat.org/2014/01/15/in-charge-of-windows-9</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Peter, an old UBC classmate and frequent co-banterer on Twitter, randomly posed an interesting question to me earlier today:<!--more--></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/liggs">@liggs</a> Serious question: if you were put in charge of Windows 9 tomorrow, what would you do with it?</p>&mdash; Peter J. Cavan (@PJCavan) <a href="https://twitter.com/PJCavan/statuses/423564952683560960">January 15, 2014</a></blockquote>


<script async src="http://liggat.org//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>I immediately replied that I think this is the single most difficult strategic question in the tech industry today, moreso even than the challenge over at BlackBerry Inc. The response, assuming I can come up with one worth the bits it&rsquo;s written on, will definitely not fit into 140-characters. Hence, a blog post.</p>

<p>The unlucky soul in charge of birthing Windows 9 has the following difficult truths to contend with:</p>

<ol>
<li>Selling operating systems to OEM-device manufacturers, as a business, is essentially dying. It&rsquo;s a sustainment business at best. This is the business model on which Windows ascended, and it&rsquo;s come to the end. There are now really only two ways to make money as an OS vendor &ndash; you wrap it in aluminum and glass and sell the whole device (Apple), or you give it away and own the market for the user&rsquo;s attention (Google). Microsoft has had a few punts at the Apple approach in the form of Zune and Surface, but has yet to set the world on fire doing this.</li>
<li>Windows 8 has not been well received by its userbase, to put it mildly. I haven&rsquo;t actually used it myself, but in terms of reception, <em>Vista 2.0</em>, does not seem an unfair moniker. Aside from the bold user-interface change<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, apparently unloved by many, the RT/Pro distinction is <em>confusing as hell</em>.</li>
<li>Mobile and tablets happened. Anyone still rattling on that iOS (or Android) is unsuitable for <em>real work™</em> is missing the point &ndash; mobile devices unbundle the Internet from the PC. Ten years ago, it was axiomatic that if you wanted to participate in online activities &ndash; Facebook, email and so on &ndash; you needed a PC, and that usually meant a Windows PC. <em>Tons</em> of PC use cases are being chipped away by more personal mobile devices, and that trend is only going to increase.</li>
<li>All of that might not be so bad if Microsoft was a major player in mobile &ndash; but it isn&rsquo;t. Mobile as it stands is a duopoly between iOS and Android, and I&rsquo;m far from convinced there&rsquo;s room for a third stack. The undoubted merits of Microsoft&rsquo;s mobile and tablet efforts in the form of Windows Phone and Surface notwithstanding &ndash; these are not yet products with a non-trivial market-share, let alone mind-share.</li>
<li>Anyone doubting any of the above need only refer to <a href="http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2013/7/20/the-irrelevance-of-microsoft">Microsoft&rsquo;s share</a> of Internet-connected devices: 90% down to 20% in just a few years.</li>
</ol>


<p>So what&rsquo;s a chief product manager of Windows 9 to do? I can&rsquo;t begin to do Peter&rsquo;s question justice, but I can offer a few humble suggestions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Windows 8 was a noble though misguided attempt to be all things to all people: multiple concepts all resident within a single device. However, we live in a <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/the-unacknowledged-compromise/">multi-device</a> world now. The machine one uses for AutoCAD design work with a mouse and keyboard needn&rsquo;t also be the same one that has a touch-enabled Twitter client in another layer. Windows 9 should therefore build upon the best parts of the generally-well-liked Windows 7, in the same way that, say, OS X Mavericks iterated upon OS X Mountain Lion &ndash; <em>without</em> attempting to change the paradigm. Better power-management, UI refinement, etc is the order of the day here.</li>
<li>Forget touch. Windows has always been about keyboard/mouse input devices, and grafting a touch layer on top is pointless. No one wants to use touch on a laptop, or God-forbid, a desktop, anyway.</li>
<li>Office remains an important business for Microsoft, and an important tool<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> for a ton of people. They are leaving a lot of money and future relevance on the table by not porting a first-class version to iOS (and Android), but even if they do &ndash; Windows should exist to provide a preeminent environment for complex applications like Office, and play to its keyboard/mouse/file-system strengths.</li>
<li>This really shouldn&rsquo;t need to be said, but native PDF viewing in Windows is an idea whose time has come.</li>
</ul>


<p>Whoever ends up driving this project has my well wishes (and sympathies). From where I stand, it&rsquo;s hard not to see it as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus">Sisyphean</a> task.</p>
<div class="footnotes">

<li id="fn:2">
<p>Well Excel is peerless anyway; I&rsquo;m less certain that anything other than organizational inertia keeps Word and PowerPoint in such widespread use.<a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

    <link href="http://liggat.org/2014/01/08/criticize-real-world-noops/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-08T20:37:42-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://liggat.org/2014/01/08/criticize-real-world-noops</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the world of computation, a <em>NOOP</em> (<em>No-Op</em>eration) is an instruction that has zero effect on the state of the machine. The term originally hails from the esoteric world of CPU-architecture and instruction-sets<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, but the term is also used semi-colloquially as programmer shorthand for <strong>&lsquo;this achieves nothing&rsquo;</strong>.<!--more--></p>

<p>A very simple example in code might be in setting a variable to the difference of itself and zero (<code>x = x - 0</code>), but they tend, as a rule, to not be so obvious. On first glance, they <em>look</em> like useful work.</p>

<p>Programmers regard NOOPs with suspicion. Good code reviewers will identify them, question their existence, and  demand exceptional justification for their continued presence. They are unwelcome in quality software not for their outcome &ndash; they do nothing after all &ndash; but because they <em>sow confusion</em>. On first glance, they appear to have a purpose; they subconsciously assuage concerns that might otherwise have been raised in their absence. Many a pernicious bug can be traced back to a NOOP that misled its programmers. A NOOP is a facade: an illusion of real work being performed.</p>

<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been thinking that the term might be applicable in the real-world also. Consider this story:</p>

<h4><a href="http://rt.com/news/france-google-fine-privacy-339/">France hands down data privacy fine to Google</a></h4>

<blockquote><p>French data protection watchdog CNIL fined Google 150,000 euros ($204,000) for ignoring its three-month deadline to align its
practice of tracking and storing user information with the country’s law.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m not commenting on<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, or even particularly interested in this French legal ruling. That&rsquo;s for France and Google Inc to work out.</p>

<p>But it seems to me that regardless of the fine&rsquo;s merit &ndash; imposing a €150,000 fine on a company which earns that amount in revenue every <em>two minutes</em><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, very closely fits the definition of a NOOP. It is the act of doing nothing masquerading as the act of doing something of significance. To an extremely close approximation, it is the judicial equivalent of subtracting zero from an integer.</p>

<p>In its article, RT makes no effort to contextualize this, and it&rsquo;s not just a failing of theirs &ndash; it&rsquo;s frankly rare in news media. This is precisely the opposite of the programmer mentality: NOOPs are always to be identified as such, and their presence criticized. The world would greatly benefit from a culture that does a better job in <strong>pointing out pointlessness</strong>.</p>
<div class="footnotes">
<hr/>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>An idle CPU can&rsquo;t actually do nothing, so they would traditionally just repeatedly execute the NOOP instruction in the absence of actual work to do. I suspect that&rsquo;s an oversimplification circa-2014 with the vast amounts of research that have gone into processor energy-efficiency.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[A New Design]]></title>
    <link href="http://liggat.org/2013/12/24/a-new-design/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-24T18:14:09-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://liggat.org/2013/12/24/a-new-design</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> as a blogging platform for over six months now, and can&rsquo;t recommend it enough for tech capable (or curious) writers. However, I&rsquo;ve never been fully happy with my minor adaptations to the default style. I finally got around to implementing an improved design.<!--more--></p>

<h3>Original</h3>

<p>My site started off looking like this:
<img class="center" src="http://liggat.org/images/2013/old-octopress-style.png" width="700" title="'Old'" ></p>

<p>It was by all means serviceable, but I was starting to tire of the excess <em>chrome</em> &ndash; the prominent header, the large nav-bar, and the unnecessary <em>Recent Posts</em> sidebar. Morever, despite numerous tweaks to the layout, colouring, and typography &ndash; it still instantly <em>looked</em> like an Octopress site<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<h3>Design Objectives</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a UI designer, either by trade or by realistic-aspiration<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Still, I had a pretty good idea in mind what I wanted my home on the web to look like.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Content Focus</strong>: This site exists for one purpose &ndash; a place to store material that I write. Anything that&rsquo;s not written content distracts from that objective. Among other things, that means the large, colourful header needs to go.</li>
<li><strong>De-Octopress the UI</strong>: Octopress is the infrastructure for this site, and will be for the far-foreseeable future. That doesn&rsquo;t mean I need to rely on its default UI styling, and in fact, I&rsquo;d greatly prefer it didn&rsquo;t <em>look</em> like an Octopress site. I still want to rely on the basic Octopress layout though, as well as its <a href="http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/01/12/guidelines-for-responsive-web-design/">responsive design</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Better Typography</strong>: I&rsquo;ve long been a little too zealous in observing the &lsquo;rule&rsquo; that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans-serif">sans-serif</a> headers should be paired with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serif">serif</a> body text. Accordingly, I initially used the serif Google Font <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Lora">Lora</a> for the body, but was never quite happy with the choice. Many blogs I read eschew serifs entirely, and the effect is well-suited to the content<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</li>
<li><strong>Better Footnote Styling</strong>: Chris Suave&rsquo;s excellent <a href="http://cmsauve.com/labs/bigfoot/">Bigfoot</a> footnote implementation is far superior to numeric in-page anchors. I wanted to replace the latter with the former (or similar).</li>
</ul>


<h3>Result</h3>

<p>With a bit of spare time over Christmas 2013, I hacked away at my blog&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/dliggat/dliggat.github.io">git repo</a> to shape the design. I&rsquo;m pretty happy with how it&rsquo;s turned out:</p>

<h4>Desktop Layout:</h4>

<p><img class="center" src="http://liggat.org/images/2013/new-octopress-style.png" width="700" title="'New'" ></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m posting the following chart from <a href="http://blog.bcaresearch.com/canadian-housing-the-bubble-debate">BCA Research</a> not for the purposes of persuasion, but rather, for posterity.<!--more--></p>

<p>If you have a sense of the historical economic similarity between Canada and the United States, understand the computation and significance of <code>price:rent</code> and <code>price:income</code> as housing valuation metrics, and yet still don&rsquo;t feel <em>even a flutter of anxiety</em> about the future of the Canadian housing market, and more importantly, the downstream economic and societal implications of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean">reversion to the mean</a> &ndash; then you&rsquo;re far beyond the power of my rhetoric to change your mind<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>As I write this, in late 2013, <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/top-business-stories/canadas-housing-market-most-overvalued-in-the-world-deutsche-bank-says/article15878166/">Deutsche Bank</a> joins a growing list of spectators whose ranks include <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21584361-america-surges-much-europe-sinks-mixed-messages">The Economist</a>, <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/101150382">Goldman-Sachs</a>, <a href="http://business.financialpost.com/2012/09/21/canada-heading-into-a-slow-motion-version-of-the-u-s-housing-bust-robert-shiller/">Robert Shiller</a>, the <a href="http://business.financialpost.com/2013/11/27/according-to-the-imf-canada-has-the-most-overvalued-housing-market-in-the-world/">IMF</a>, <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/top-business-stories/nouriel-roubini-aka-dr-doom-warns-of-frothy-canadian-housing-market/article15807846/">Nouriel Roubini</a>, and <a href="http://ca.finance.yahoo.com/blogs/balance-sheet/paul-krugman-warns-canada-vulnerable-big-deleveraging-shock-183728127.html">Paul Krugman</a> &ndash; all of whom have expressed incredulity and/or concern in one form or another about the stratospheric valuations in the Canadian housing market.</p>

<p>My opinion, irrelevant and disinterested<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> though it may be, is very straightforward, and has been unchanged for several years now: <strong>this will end badly</strong>, for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)">leveraged</a> and unleveraged, alike. Just ask anyone from the Republic of Ireland. Or look a little closer to home &ndash; below the 49th Parallel.</p>

<p>Feel free to disagree with me<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. Most Canadians do, at least as a default position. But if you do disagree, surely it&rsquo;s at least partially concerning to witness all this opposing consensus among weighty, if not necessarily clairvoyant, external parties?</p>

    <link href="http://liggat.org/2013/11/30/a-minor-rant-on-package-tracking/"/>
    <updated>2013-11-30T23:11:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://liggat.org/2013/11/30/a-minor-rant-on-package-tracking</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I do a fair bit of online shopping<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and have done so for pretty much my entire credit-card-wielding life. It&rsquo;s a familiar ritual: every time, shortly after I&rsquo;ve clicked <code>Purchase</code>, an email arrives containing a linked phrase with roughly the following copy: <em>Click here to track your shipment</em>. <!--more-->And every time I receive that email, I dutifully click that link, only to be met with the following 404-esque response:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://liggat.org/images/2013/tracking.png" width="600" title="'tracking'" ></p>

<p>It does not seem to matter whether the year is 2005 or 2013, and whether the logistics handler in question is Canada Post, USPS, UPS, etc &ndash; this is invariably the experience. This is a minor but absolutely-nagging annoyance if you know anything about software. It does not need to be this way.</p>

<p>Subsequent to the buyer&rsquo;s order, the seller and the logistics handler must perform an asynchronous (with respect to the buyer) transaction in which, among other things, data is exchanged regarding the delivery to be executed. At some point in this process, the seller is provided with a tracking number for that delivery, which they happily relay to the buyer in the aforesaid email. Therefore, when the buyer excitedly clicks on the tracking link, they are performing a lookup of <strong>a record that is certain to exist somewhere on the logistics handler&rsquo;s systems</strong>, and yet are <em>told</em> it doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>

<p>I imagine that at this point, given the opportunity, the CTO of one of these logistics handler outfits might loudly interject <em>&ldquo;Well, of course &ndash; but the consumer web frontend and the logistics backend are entirely separate systems that we need to batch transfer over, and because of our legacy&hellip; and because of our storage requirements&hellip; and because of our load balancing&hellip; and because of Sarbanes-Oxley&hellip; and&hellip;.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>And I&rsquo;m sure these would all be perfectly justified reasons, within the infrastructure team of that firm. The point is though, I don&rsquo;t care <strong>why</strong> the tracker was <em>unable to find any results</em>. And neither does any other user. This is a bad experience, and they can, and should do better. A few suggestions, in increasing order of implementation complexity:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make a better <em>unable to find any results</em> page. Acknowledge that this is a new tracking number, and will be in the systems shortly. Provide a timeframe. Differentiate between new numbers, and erroneous ones (use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum">checksumming</a> scheme in the numbers themselves if necessary).</li>
<li>Coordinate with the seller. Don&rsquo;t fire out emails containing tracking links until both the seller and the logistics handler agree that the delivery will be performed, a tracking number exists, and the tracking number is queryable. I don&rsquo;t want an email with a link that I can&rsquo;t use until some unspecified period has passed.</li>
<li>Build better infrastructure. It is well within the ability of humanity&rsquo;s current software engineering to run systems without such absurd temporal lags within a single organization&rsquo;s infrastructure. This is not an especially complex technical problem. If your logistics and web-query systems are entirely separate, and they take 6 hours to propagate records &ndash; get that 6 down to 5. Then to 4. Then to 3. Etc.</li>
</ol>


<p>Clearly, this is not an important concern in the grand scheme of the universe. Invariably, the links start working eventually, and the packages arrive. But the triviality is no reason to not demand a modicum of progress.</p>

    <link href="http://liggat.org/2013/11/03/static-hosting-on-amazon-s3/"/>
    <updated>2013-11-03T13:13:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://liggat.org/2013/11/03/static-hosting-on-amazon-s3</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve had an outstanding <strong>todo</strong> for quite some time to migrate my basic and essentially-static <a href="http://www.factorialsystems.ca">business website</a> off of <a href="http://www.squarespace.com">Squarespace</a>. I ended up replacing it with a combination of <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> and Amazon Simple Storage Service (<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3">S3</a>), which, it turns out, are a fantastic duo.<!--more--></p>

<h3>Prelude</h3>

<p>A brief prelude: Squarespace is fantastic, and should be the first port of call for anyone, especially a business, who needs a website. I can&rsquo;t even enumerate the number of ostensibly well-run restaurants and businesses who either don&rsquo;t have a website, or if they do, it&rsquo;s some horrid Flash-payload thing that won&rsquo;t run on the primary device customers tend to be using at the point of need: their phones! Squarespace isn&rsquo;t free, but is totally worth the small monthly cost for pretty much anyone.</p>

<p>I started my business site there due to a combination of being overwhelmingly-busy at the time, as well as generally curious about the service&hellip; but it eventually became time for me to move on<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<h3>Octopress</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve become quite enamoured with Octopress &ndash; the blogging engine that I use for this site (and host on GitHub). I like to think of it as the anti-Wordpress &ndash; it produces good, old-fashioned directory trees of HTML pages from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">markdown</a>-formatted source files and <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> style sheets. No application server or database, and the attendant care and feeding, required &ndash; just a plain old web server serving files<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. This is a perfect choice, it turns out, for a basic company site. It has all the necessary infrastructure for blogging, should that become necessary, and has built-in responsive design and other niceties.</p>

<h3>Hosting</h3>

<p>S3 is Amazon Web Services&#8217; online file storage service (distributed, redundant, RESTful, etc). It is purportedly used as the persistence backend for <a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>, among others. My needs are considerably more modest &ndash; I just want it to store and serve my site content. It turns out it has an option for exactly this purpose:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://liggat.org/images/2013/s3.png" width="600" title="'S3 Static Website Hosting'" ></p>

<p>Thus, a static website with Octopress and S3 requires that you simply:</p>

<ol>
<li>create content within an Octopress repository</li>
<li>execute Octopress&#8217; <code>bundle exec rake generate</code> to produce static HTML</li>
<li>deploy the output to an S3 bucket (<code>bundle exec rake deploy</code>)</li>
</ol>


<h3>Deploying</h3>

<p>Out of the box, Octopress does not know how to deploy to S3. That&rsquo;s easily remedied via an extension to the <code>Rakefile</code> that I found via this <a href="http://www.jerome-bernard.com/blog/2011/08/20/quick-tip-for-easily-deploying-octopress-blog-on-amazon-s3/">blog post</a>. With that <code>s3</code> rake task added, and S3 bucket variables defined, it&rsquo;s simply a matter of running <code>bundle exec rake deploy</code>. to deploy new content. The underlying <code>s3cmd</code> is, obviously, smart enough to only send content deltas to the S3 bucket.</p>

<h3>Cost</h3>

<p>At the time of writing, Amazon charges 9.5¢ per Gigabyte-month for the first 1TB of storage (cheaper thereafter), plus 0.5¢ per 1000 RESTful (GET, PUT, etc) operations, plus some minimal data transfer charge. One reasonable way to describe this might be: <strong>extremely inexpensive</strong>!</p>

<h3>So Far, So Good</h3>

<p>Thus far, I&rsquo;m really happy with this setup. My personal blog, this site, is currently hosted on <a href="http://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, but I&rsquo;ll probably move this over to S3 also. Obviously, the static site constraint remains &ndash; I can&rsquo;t, for instance, have a page with a form, or an XHR endpoint, etc. But if those should become necessary &ndash; it&rsquo;s very easy to upgrade to an EC2 instance with Rails, and remain within the Amazon ecosystem. I guess that&rsquo;s how they get you&hellip;</p>
<div class="footnotes">
<hr/>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>Squarespace is definitely overkill for a static site if you have the time, knowledge and inclination to host it elsewhere. But many website-needing entities do not possess the intersection of those properties &ndash; hence the genius of Squarespace as a product itself.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>This resultant simplicity has an inherent appeal &ndash; not dissimilar to that, for me, of iOS vs OS X. The former trades possibility for simplicity &ndash; a desirable exchange in many (but obviously not all) scenarios.<a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:3">
<p>GitHub Pages hosts static sites for free &ndash; not wishing to trespass on GitHub&rsquo;s awesomeness, I reasoned that I should probably pay for the business site&rsquo;s hosting. All 68¢ of it, or whatever the final bill ends up being.<a href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

    <updated>2013-10-15T10:41:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://liggat.org/2013/10/15/walter-white</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been re-watching <em>Breaking Bad</em>, one of my favourite television dramas, ever. Yesterday, midway through an early second season episode, I noticed a connection to a much later point in the story that I haven&rsquo;t seen discussed anywhere else.</p>

<!--more-->


<p><em>Don&rsquo;t read this if you&rsquo;re keen to avoid Breaking Bad plot details.</em></p>

<h3>The Painting</h3>

<p>By the midpoint of season five<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, Walter is at the height of his Heisenberg-persona hubris. He&rsquo;s built his own drug empire, defeated his enemies &ndash; notably Fring, and still gone unnoticed by law enforcement. He&rsquo;s invincible. As if to telegraph this &ndash; while Uncle Jack and his band of Nazis are struggling over the minutiae of their planned murderous rampage at three separate Albuquerque jails &ndash; Walt stares at a painting in the motel room, uninterested in the conversation around him.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://liggat.org/images/2013/painting_second.jpg" width="500" title="Painting in the Motel" ></p>

<p>He idly speculates: <em>Where do you suppose these come from? I&rsquo;ve seen this one before. I wonder &ndash; are they all in some giant warehouse someplace?</em>, and invites the ire of Uncle Jack &ndash; incredulous at his lack of focus on planning the operation.</p>

<h3>First Appearance</h3>

<p>It turns out that this same painting featured much earlier in the story<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. A browbeaten Walt was finishing up a chemotherapy session, and spent a moment staring at a print of it on the hospital wall. The camera lingers at what is surely an instance of symbolism: the painting is of a man, rowing <em>away</em> from his family on the shore towards a waiting ship.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://liggat.org/images/2013/painting_first.jpg" width="500" title="Painting in the Hospital" ></p>

<p>Walt&rsquo;s comment is therefore made with the recognition that he&rsquo;s noticed at least two of these things in the wild. Virtually the only constant between these two moments in the <em>Breaking Bad</em> story is the notion of that warehouse somewhere, churning out an endless supply of mediocre stock art.</p>

<p>The inclusion of, and callback to, this painting is just one more in another long line of fantastic touches by the show&rsquo;s creators.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Simulating the Birthday Paradox]]></title>
    <link href="http://liggat.org/2013/10/13/simulating-the-birthday-paradox/"/>
    <updated>2013-10-13T10:59:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://liggat.org/2013/10/13/simulating-the-birthday-paradox</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Probability theory is a pretty special branch of mathematics in the sense that it is (1) highly applicable to daily life; (2) many of its results are easily comprehensible to most people; and yet despite this (3) it remains a profoundly complex area of mathematical inquiry<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.<!--more--></p>

<p>An example which perfectly encapsulates this is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_paradox">birthday paradox</a>. In short, it can be represented by the question:</p>

<blockquote><p>With a group of <code>N</code> randomly chosen people, how large does <code>N</code> need to be so that there&rsquo;s a 50% chance of a shared birthday within the group?</p></blockquote>

<p>The birthday paradox is a great opportunity to use some basic computation as an exploratory tool. I think more people should have the ability to use this.</p>

<h3>Finding N</h3>

<p>The group size is clearly less than or equal to 365. Above 365, we know with 100% certainty that there&rsquo;s a shared birthday somewhere<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Intuition (or at least my intuition before I knew the answer) usually suggests that the 50% probability threshold value for N is probably at or around the 100-150 mark. In other words, we might guess that you need 100-150 people in the group before the probability of a shared birthday is equal to a coin flip.</p>

<p>It turns out that&rsquo;s a gross overestimate. The actual value is <strong>staggeringly lower</strong> than people tend to guess:</p>

<blockquote><p>With a group size of 23 people, the probability that two people share a birthday is ~= 50.36%.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is a pretty astonishing result. It is, of course, provably true by an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_paradox#Calculating_the_probability">analytical argument</a>, but it is actually far easier to convince oneself of its trueness with a simple computational exercise (full version on <a href="https://gist.github.com/dliggat/6963840">GitHub</a>):</p>

<p>This very simple code runs a series of birthday-paradox experiments &ndash; within each trial, it generates a group of people, and tests for the presence of a shared birthday. By doing this repeatedly, a thousand times in this case, we can approximate the actual probability of a shared birthday with a particular group size.</p>

<h3>Why Bother Sharing This?</h3>

<p>To any mildly-capable programmer<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, none of this is particularly interesting or novel. Many of us in this line of work have a pretty decent mathematical background, and have done all sorts of these little simulation exercises in the past, both academically and professionally.</p>

<p>However, it is my firm belief that a great many people could stand to benefit if the ability to use basic computational principles and tools were more widely disseminated. Windows and OS X machines ship with browsers with full JavaScript runtimes; Ruby and Python runtimes <em>ship</em> with OS X, and can easily be added to Windows. The tools of exploratory computation are everywhere &ndash; but very few people were ever given the knowledge to use them. This could be easily remedied by offering basic Computer Science in high school, either on its own, or as part of a math or science class. This might be the case today for all I know, but my own experience on that front was not encouraging<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>To anyone even moderately interested in the vast possibilities that are unlocked with a bit of computational knowledge, I strongly encourage you to check out <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Code Academy</a> or <a href="http://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a>. Of all of Steve Jobs&#8217; various witty and insightful aphorisms, the notion that a computer is a <em>bicycle for the mind</em> has always struck me as especially apt.</p>

<p>Around the time I was in grade 11 and 12, Computer Science was <em>dropped</em> as an offering at my high school. Yes, <em>dropped</em>. Lack of demand; lack of staff to teach it. University was thus my first opportunity to gain exposure to computation as an academic/professional field.<a href="#fnref:4" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://teamcoco.com/video/louis-ck-springsteen-cell-phone">Another</a> of Louis C.K.&rsquo;s hilarious talk-show interview diatribes is being widely circulated on the web and Twitter right now &ndash; this time about smartphones, and why he won&rsquo;t let his children have one. It&rsquo;s well worth a watch, but his argument essentially boils down to the observation that smartphones provide a constant stream of distraction that removes the condition, boredom, that is arguably necessary for healthy self-reflection.<!--more--></p>

<p>Humour aside, I think he&rsquo;s really onto something here. Speaking personally, boredom, at least how I understood the term pre-Internet, has essentially disappeared from my life. Very few of my waking hours are spent without mental stimulation of one form or another. If I&rsquo;m waiting in a lineup, on public transport, unable to sleep, or killing time in an airport &ndash; out comes my phone, and the usual suspects <a href="http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/">Tweetbot</a> or <a href="http://instapaper.com">Instapaper</a> will occupy me for the duration of that transitory event. Even when I&rsquo;m cooking, cycling, exercising, or walking the dog, I&rsquo;m spared from any possible exposure to boredom through a now-years-old tendency to listen to podcasts<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> or audiobooks whenever my hands are occupied.</p>

<p>As a technophile and enthusiast-for-non-boredom, it&rsquo;s hard for me to know how I should feel about this state of affairs. It&rsquo;s fairly easy to reason that since happiness may only exist in a world with sadness, then perhaps excitement and boredom share a similar, inextricable, symbiosis? I certainly don&rsquo;t currently <em>feel</em> like my life: work, personal or otherwise, lacks excitement &ndash; far from it. But this is 2013 &ndash; what about 2033 when we have <em>{insert your favourite prediction about technology two decades out<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>}</em>?</p>

<p>Kids born in the recent past seem to be genuinely puzzled when they encounter a display which is not touch-sensitive, and I find it likely that this will be their response at the very notion of boredom as a concept in the years to come. I feel privileged to have grown up during that big epoch-defining<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> transition from pre-Internet to our now permanent state of connectedness. I have vivid memories of what it was like to have only four TV channels and a few toys and books as the sole available vehicles for entertainment; and still more vivid memories of the initial realizations that I now had the power to answer virtually any question I could conceive of with just a few keystrokes.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think the significance of this shift has been truly internalized by many people yet. Other than Louis C.K., of course.</p>
