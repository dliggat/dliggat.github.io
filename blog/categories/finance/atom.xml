    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve found myself explaining to some friends and family members the precise difference between a regular (i.e. non-registered) account, an RRSP account, and a TFSA account. In particular, many Canadians hold the mistaken belief that these accounts are <em>products</em> &ndash; a thing that the bank creates and sells. This is incorrect &ndash; <strong>accounts are containers</strong>, into which the same assets (cash savings, stocks, etc) can be placed. The type of the container merely specifies how its gains are taxed, nothing more.<!--more--></p>

<blockquote><p>The type of the container merely specifies how its gains are taxed, nothing more.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Non-registered</h3>

<p>A non-registered account is simply an ordinary container with no special tax treatment. It can hold cash savings, stocks, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds, etc. A vanilla savings account is one such example, but a stock trading account could qualify also. Any &lsquo;gains&rsquo; from the assets in this container are subject to taxation, though it&rsquo;s worth noting that the various types of &lsquo;gain&rsquo; (e.g. interest, Canadian dividends, foreign dividends, capital gains) are each handled in their own special way &ndash; this is where the unfortunate complexity of the tax code rears its head. Regardless, bottom line: <strong>you pay tax on any gains in a non-registered account</strong>.</p>

<h3>RRSP</h3>

<p>An RRSP account is a container designed with retirement needs in mind. Like the non-registered account, it may hold a variety of asset types. It is taxed in a notable manner: when you <em>contribute</em> money to this account, you actually receive a reduction in your tax-payable for the year, today<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. However, when you <em>withdraw</em> money, usually in retirement, that money is treated as if it were salary income &ndash; and taxed accordingly. In the meantime, the assets in the container grow <em>tax-free</em> through the usual means (interest, dividends, capital gains).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.michaeljamesonmoney.com/2014/03/cra-your-rrsp-partners-whether-you-want.html">Michael James</a> has documented an excellent way to think of this transaction: in exchange for a reduction in this year&rsquo;s taxes, you grant the <a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/menu-eng.html">CRA</a> an ownership stake in the future value of your RRSP container. This turns out to be a beneficial manoeuvre so long as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_rate#Marginal">marginal</a> tax rate on the contributed money is lower than the <em>[unknowable but presumably and hopefully lower]</em> marginal tax rate at retirement. Bottom line: <strong>in an RRSP, you get a reduction in taxes today in exchange for granting the CRA a stake in the container&rsquo;s eventual disbursements</strong>.</p>

<h3>TFSA</h3>

<p>A TFSA is a container whose gains (interest, dividends, capital gains, etc) are <strong>never subject to taxation</strong>. Because that&rsquo;s such an attractive proposition, the government only permits adult individuals to contribute $5000 per year<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Assuming wise and/or fortunate investing decisions<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, the TFSA has the potential to grow substantially over a multi-decade period, and will result in a container of assets which is not subject to any taxation. Bottom line: <strong>Any growth within a TFSA is never taxed but only a limited contribution per year is permitted</strong>.</p>

<h3>Which Should I Use?</h3>

<p>It can be complicated. There is a ton of nuance to the rules governing the above, and this is not financial advice. With these general frameworks in mind, the question for every individual to be asking themselves is: <em>&ldquo;given my tax and income situation and future plans and possible scenarios, which of these gives me the most advantage?&rdquo;</em>. Each of these has a possible role to play, though the TFSA in particular is an excellent vehicle for investing. The opportunity it represents should not be squandered, in my view.</p>

<h3>Who cares &ndash; this is boring!</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m somewhat sympathetic to that claim. However, ignorance in the basics of this topic is very, very costly &ndash; in missed tax-saving opportunities and in selecting highly-suboptimal financial products. The price for ignorance is <em>substantial</em> personal expense. It&rsquo;s well worth a cursory knowledge of how these containers work, and how they can be used to advance one&rsquo;s freedom, happiness and life goals – which is of course the primary underlying objective of any personal finance initiative.</p>

    <updated>2013-09-06T09:52:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://liggat.org/2013/09/06/efficient-currency-conversion</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m willing to bet that Canadians, on average, do more foreign exchange (forex) transactions than citizens of many other countries. This is an obvious consequence of the significant shopping and investing opportunities south of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/49th_parallel_north#The_Canada_.E2.80.93_United_States_border">49th parallel</a>. Moreover, plenty of Canadian software contractors such as myself find themselves billing in American dollars (<span class="money usd">USD</span>) occasionally.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Unfortunately, currency conversion to and from Canadian dollars (<span class="money cad">CAD</span>) is no exception to that frequently-bemoaned axiom of Canadian life: it&rsquo;s expensive, and domestic vendors extract a cosy profit margin (i.e. banks in this case). This phenomenon is perennially annoying<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> in general, but especially so when we&rsquo;re talking about <em>bits in a database</em>, which is all money really is at this point.</p>

<p>However, it turns out there&rsquo;s a neat trick you can pull off to convert <span class="money cad">CAD</span> ⇔ <span class="money usd">USD</span> [almost] optimally called <strong>Norbert&rsquo;s Gambit</strong>. There are plenty of <a href="http://canadiancouchpotato.com/2013/07/09/norberts-gambit-at-cibc/">other</a> <a href="http://www.canadiancapitalist.com/a-foolproof-method-to-convert-canadian-dollars-into-us-dollars/">blog</a> <a href="http://www.michaeljamesonmoney.com/2012/03/trying-norbert-gambit-at-bmo.html">posts</a> out there explaining this &ndash; I thought I&rsquo;d throw my hat into the ring also by documenting my experience. <em>This hopefully goes without saying, but this is a personal record of events by a layman of finance, not the provision of financial advice. Your mileage may vary &ndash; do your own research.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn't_read">tl; dr</a> version:</p>

<blockquote><p>In conversion rate terms, this is a gain of $138.25 CAD over what the bank offered on the $5,000.00 USD conversion.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/forex.jpg" width="325" title="&lsquo;Forex&rsquo;" >
For the sake of completeness, it is worth mentioning the concept of the <strong>mid-market rate</strong> in forex. Although we tend to think of a unit of currency having a fixed, reversible value in a different currency (e.g. <span class="money usd price">$1.00 USD</span> = <span class="money cad price">$1.05 CAD</span>), generally no one will sell you the opposite currency at that rate. Currency conversion boards seen in train stations and airports illustrate this concept; they show <em>two rates</em> &ndash; vendors will transact in the opposite currency at a higher or lower rate, depending on whether you wish to buy or sell, respectively. The difference, of course, is their profit<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The mid-market rate is theoretically equidistant between the two rates, and it&rsquo;s the rate we would ideally achieve when we participate in a forex transaction. Mid-market rates for currency pairs are reported on <a href="http://finance.google.com">Google Finance</a>, <a href="http://xe.com">XE</a>, etc.</p>

<h3>Objective</h3>

<p>My objective on the morning of <strong>2013-09-05</strong> was to convert <span class="money usd price">$5,000.00 USD</span> to <span class="money cad">CAD</span> as efficiently as possible. The value of that sum of money, in <span class="money cad">CAD</span>, implied by the mid-market rate at the time was <span class="money cad price">$5,252.15 CAD</span>. In optimization terms, this is a clear <em>upper bound</em> on the quantity I&rsquo;m trying to maximize.</p>

<h5>Option A: Bank Transfer</h5>

<p>As far as I&rsquo;m aware, most Canadian banks allow for a immediate conversion of <span class="money cad">CAD</span> ⇔ <span class="money usd">USD</span> online from a <span class="money cad">CAD</span>-denominated account to a <span class="money usd">USD</span>-denominated account or vice-versa. In a matter of seconds, one can perform this transaction. The price for this convenience, however, is the suboptimal forex rate that they apply<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. My bank offered me <span class="money cad price">$5,112.50 CAD</span> in exchange for <span class="money usd price">$5,000.00 USD</span> on <strong>2013-09-05</strong>. Easy, and hassle-free &ndash; but we can do better.</p>

<h5>Option B: Third Party Currency Trader</h5>

<p>Rather than use the functionality built into online banking, we can outsource the conversion to an outfit like <a href="http://xe.com">XE</a>. It&rsquo;s a bit of a hassle to set up, and the website is straight out of 2002, but that aside, it does exactly what it says on the tin. You book a trade; money gets withdrawn in one currency (e.g. <span class="money cad">CAD</span>) and shows up a few days later, converted, in the other currency (e.g. <span class="money usd">USD</span>). I&rsquo;ve used XE on very seldom occasions across a duration of many years and it has always worked out great. On the morning of <strong>2013-09-05</strong>, they quoted a rate of <span class="money cad price">$5,186.72 CAD</span> in exchange for <span class="money usd price">$5,000.00 USD</span>. Not quite the mid-market rate, but this is already an improvement of <span class="money cad price">$74.22 CAD</span> over Option A.</p>

<h3>Option C: Norbert&rsquo;s Gambit</h3>

<p>The process for doing even better relies on what I understand to be the following approximate logic:</p>

<ul>
<li>Start with money in a given currency, say, <span class="money usd">USD</span>.</li>
<li>Use that money to purchase units of a security that lists on both the NYSE and TSX. Through the magic of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage">arbitrage</a>, the security on both markets will tend towards an identical price (even if traded in different currencies).</li>
<li>Once you own it on the NYSE, ask your broker to swap it for equivalent units on the TSX.</li>
<li>Sell those TSX-listed units of the security, now denominated in <span class="money cad">CAD</span>.</li>
<li>Congratulations &ndash; all going well, you just converted <span class="money usd ">USD</span> to <span class="money cad">CAD</span> at essentially the mid-market rate. Provided, of course, the security didn&rsquo;t fluctuate much in value between the two trades.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Outcome</h3>

<p>In practice, it seems you don&rsquo;t need to worry too much about the price fluctuation between trades. An <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund">ETF</a> with symbol <a href="http://www.horizonsetfs.com/pub/en/etfs/?etf=DLR&amp;">DLR</a> was apparently created as a stable vehicle for precisely this manoeuvre. I followed <a href="http://www.michaeljamesonmoney.com/2012/03/trying-norbert-gambit-at-bmo.html">these instructions</a> closely and it worked out exactly as described. On <strong>2013-09-05</strong>, I phoned the broker<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, bought DLR.U with <span class="money usd">USD</span>, exchanged it for DLR, and immediately sold to receive <span class="money cad">CAD</span>.</p>

<p>In actual numeric terms, I bought <span class="money usd">502 DLR.U × $9.97 USD/DLR.U</span> = <span class="money usd price">$5,004.94 USD</span> and subsequently sold <span class="money cad">502 DLR × $10.47 CAD/DLR</span> = <span class="money cad price">$5,255.94 CAD</span>. In conversion rate terms, this is a gain of <span class="money cad price">$138.25 CAD</span> over what the bank offered on the <span class="money usd price">$5,000.00 USD</span> conversion, and the achieved rate <em>is</em> the mid-market rate to three decimal places.</p>

<h4>But wait! There&rsquo;s More</h4>

<p>We can&rsquo;t just call this a <span class="money cad price">$138.25 CAD</span> job well done though. I had to execute two trades&hellip; and trading has transaction costs. Depending on your bank/broker, and various policies, etc, this could be anywhere from $5.00 to $30.00 each direction. So the savings realized in this scenario is actually: <span class="money cad price">$138.25 CAD &ndash; 2 × { cost per trade }</span>. Still, it&rsquo;s a pretty good outcome for doing basically nothing but a bit of one-time research. And the savings scale in proportion to the amount converted!</p>

<p>This is part of the reason<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> why banks are so ludicrously profitable. It&rsquo;s all just bits in a database&hellip; but the act of flipping those bits can come at a higher or lower cost depending on how you tell the bank to manipulate them.</p>

<h4>Summary of Implied Rates</h4>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the various rates summarized. Note that the Norbert&rsquo;s Gambit result <strong>does not</strong> include the cost of the trades, which must be accounted for in practice.</p>

<p>One last remark: it&rsquo;s probably wise to be circumspect within any dealings with your bank when setting up accounts for this or actually executing the trade. Norbert&rsquo;s Gambit<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> is a perfectly legitimate operation, but it&rsquo;s pretty easy to imagine banks getting upset at this reduction in their effortless-profit, and potentially erecting obstacles.</p>
