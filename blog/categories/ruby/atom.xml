    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With the proliferation of smartphones, most people now have an excellent camera with them at all times, and are taking many more photographs per year than ever before.<!--more--></p>

<p>However, the current state of photo management on contemporary desktop and mobile operating systems is, frankly, abysmal. Apple, previously the standards-bearer in this arena through the mid-2000s with their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9046oXrm7f8">digital hub</a> strategy, seems to have lost interest in maintaining iPhoto and Aperture as serious photo asset management tools<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Adobe Lightroom is expensive, complex and unnecessary for most non-professional purposes. Everpix, sadly, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/5/5039216/everpix-life-and-death-inside-the-worlds-best-photo-startup">failed</a> to build a business around photo management.</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>So what&rsquo;s the answer? I wanted a way to manage my past and future photos with the following characteristics:</p>

<ol>
<li>Every photo in my collection (over 10,000 and counting since 2003), and every photo I take from now on, should be preserved by default in an archive with its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata">metadata</a> intact.</li>
<li>This archive should have a robust local and offsite backup strategy &ndash; photographs are irreplaceable, and their value to the creator increases with time.</li>
<li>This archive should be as futureproof as possible &ndash; I want to be able to view my photos at any point in the future regardless of device, machine migration, etc.</li>
<li>I should have the ability to view any photo in my collection from a mobile device, i.e. my iPhone or iPad, without having it cached locally.</li>
<li>It should be painless and hassle-free to add new photos into the archive, and thus the backup process.</li>
</ol>


<p>Inspired by <a href="http://www.macstories.net/tutorials/my-photo-management-workflow-early-2014/">Federico Viticci</a>, I&rsquo;ve migrated my photo library to a new system and ongoing process that works really well for me.</p>

<h3>iPhoto => Files &amp; Directories</h3>

<p>Requirement 3, at a stroke, entirely disqualifies database-based applications<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> like iPhoto. As my accumulated photo library was sitting in the increasingly-creaky iPhoto, the first step was to export the original <code>.jpg</code> files. The archive is therefore maintained as a set of files and directories going forward, and is thus highly future-proof.</p>

<p>The single most critical piece of metadata about a photograph is its creation date. Without this, it is inordinately difficult to find a particular photo, or preserve a sense of the original chronology of a series.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, file system metadata is insufficient as a repository for this signal. Machine migrations, underlying file system changes, and general <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_rot">bit rot</a> conspire to render this inadequate and fragile. Therefore, it makes sense to encode a photograph&rsquo;s creation date, available in the exif data, right inside its filename.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/">Exiftool</a>, available in <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew for OS X</a> is a great way to achieve this. After exporting from iPhoto, I was able to rename each file:</p>

<pre><code>exiftool "-FileName&lt;CreateDate" -d "%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S%%-c.%%le" export
</code></pre>

<h3>Binning the Files</h3>

<p>The above operation resulted in a directory with 10,000 <code>.jpg</code> files with an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iso8601#General_principles">ISO8601</a>-like filename, e.g.: <code>2011-02-03_16-12-11.jpg</code>. A bit unwieldy, but chronological and consistent. The next step was to separate these files by month, which I accomplished with a simple bit of Ruby (original on <a href="https://gist.github.com/dliggat/9677631">GitHub</a>):</p>

<h3>Storage, Backup, Viewing</h3>

<p>I decided that the best place to actually store this [so-far] 55GB archive was on Google Drive. This has a few benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cheap</strong>: At $2 per month for 100GB of storage as of the <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.ca/2014/03/save-more-with-google-drive.html">recent price drop</a>, it&rsquo;s hard to argue with the price.</li>
<li><strong>Local and Offsite Backup</strong>: These files live locally in <code>~/GoogleDrive</code> and therefore get subsumed into my wireless home network backups, but also have a disaster-mitigating copy on the cloud.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile Viewing</strong>: The iOS Google Drive app has quietly become a really high-quality piece of iOS software. It&rsquo;s a capable photo viewing app, and easily satisfies the mobile-viewing requirement (though I&rsquo;d like to see <a href="http://unboundapp.com/">Unbound</a> support it eventually also).</li>
</ul>


<p><img class="center" src="/images/2014/gd.png" width="600" title="&lsquo;Google Drive&rsquo;" ></p>

<h3>Dealing with New Photos</h3>

<p>All of this so far covers requirements 1 through 4 splendidly. However, it&rsquo;s all a bit pointless if new photos aren&rsquo;t subsumed into this system on a hassle-free, ongoing basis. The final puzzle piece is also the most convoluted, but so far it seems to be holding up nicely:</p>

<ol>
<li>Take advantage of Dropbox&rsquo;s Camera Upload<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> functionality to send new photos over WiFi from my iPhone to the <code>~/Dropbox/Camera Uploads</code> directory on my Mac. This will happen in the background occasionally without any intervention from me, or I can trigger it manually whenever I want. Of course, <code>.jpg</code> files from other cameras can be placed here also<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</li>
<li>Use <a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel">Hazel</a> to watch that directory and segregate iOS screenshots (no need to archive those) and videos (I&rsquo;m still deciding how they should be handled), and then rename all <code>.jpg</code> files to the ISO8601-style format above. In this case, given the recency, it is reasonable to rely on the file metadata to encode the creation date in the filename.</li>
<li>Again with Hazel watching that directory, send those renamed files to <code>~/GoogleDrive/Photos</code>.</li>
<li>Another Hazel rule watching <code>~/GoogleDrive/Photos</code> will &ldquo;sort into subfolders&rdquo; and place each file into its appropriate year-month directory (e.g. <code>2014-03-Mar</code>), creating that directory if necessary.</li>
</ol>


<p><img class="center" src="/images/2014/hazel.png" width="600" title="&lsquo;Hazel&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it! The archive is consistent, future-proof, viewable and has a strong backup-strategy &ndash; and all new photos from now on have a frictionless pathway into it.</p>

<p>While I&rsquo;m happy with this system for me (and eventually I&rsquo;ll roll it out to my family) Apple, Google, Microsoft, et al really need to solve this problem for their customers. Photos are precious, and people, as a rule, are far worse at ensuring the longevity of bits than paper.</p>
<div class="footnotes">
<hr/>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>They were never very good, anyway.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>It is generally a bad idea to rely on these type of programs if you care about accessing your data in the distant future. It will likely be difficult, or at best inconvenient, to read a circa-2014 iPhoto library in 2024. I make an <a href="http://liggat.org/2013/07/21/paperless/">exception</a> in the case of Evernote.<a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:3">
<p>Ideally I wouldn&rsquo;t be relying on two separate cloud-storage providers, but the combination of Google Drive pricing and Dropbox functionality is compelling. Future changes will be easy, anyhow, depending on how the storage market evolves.<a href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:4">
<p>So far this doesn&rsquo;t really apply, as the only camera I use is my iPhone 5s. I hung up my SLR a few years ago.<a href="#fnref:4" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

    <updated>2013-10-13T10:59:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://liggat.org/2013/10/13/simulating-the-birthday-paradox</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Probability theory is a pretty special branch of mathematics in the sense that it is (1) highly applicable to daily life; (2) many of its results are easily comprehensible to most people; and yet despite this (3) it remains a profoundly complex area of mathematical inquiry<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.<!--more--></p>

<p>An example which perfectly encapsulates this is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_paradox">birthday paradox</a>. In short, it can be represented by the question:</p>

<blockquote><p>With a group of <code>N</code> randomly chosen people, how large does <code>N</code> need to be so that there&rsquo;s a 50% chance of a shared birthday within the group?</p></blockquote>

<p>The birthday paradox is a great opportunity to use some basic computation as an exploratory tool. I think more people should have the ability to use this.</p>

<h3>Finding N</h3>

<p>The group size is clearly less than or equal to 365. Above 365, we know with 100% certainty that there&rsquo;s a shared birthday somewhere<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Intuition (or at least my intuition before I knew the answer) usually suggests that the 50% probability threshold value for N is probably at or around the 100-150 mark. In other words, we might guess that you need 100-150 people in the group before the probability of a shared birthday is equal to a coin flip.</p>

<p>It turns out that&rsquo;s a gross overestimate. The actual value is <strong>staggeringly lower</strong> than people tend to guess:</p>

<blockquote><p>With a group size of 23 people, the probability that two people share a birthday is ~= 50.36%.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is a pretty astonishing result. It is, of course, provably true by an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_paradox#Calculating_the_probability">analytical argument</a>, but it is actually far easier to convince oneself of its trueness with a simple computational exercise (full version on <a href="https://gist.github.com/dliggat/6963840">GitHub</a>):</p>

<p>This very simple code runs a series of birthday-paradox experiments &ndash; within each trial, it generates a group of people, and tests for the presence of a shared birthday. By doing this repeatedly, a thousand times in this case, we can approximate the actual probability of a shared birthday with a particular group size.</p>

<h3>Why Bother Sharing This?</h3>

<p>To any mildly-capable programmer<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, none of this is particularly interesting or novel. Many of us in this line of work have a pretty decent mathematical background, and have done all sorts of these little simulation exercises in the past, both academically and professionally.</p>

<p>However, it is my firm belief that a great many people could stand to benefit if the ability to use basic computational principles and tools were more widely disseminated. Windows and OS X machines ship with browsers with full JavaScript runtimes; Ruby and Python runtimes <em>ship</em> with OS X, and can easily be added to Windows. The tools of exploratory computation are everywhere &ndash; but very few people were ever given the knowledge to use them. This could be easily remedied by offering basic Computer Science in high school, either on its own, or as part of a math or science class. This might be the case today for all I know, but my own experience on that front was not encouraging<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>To anyone even moderately interested in the vast possibilities that are unlocked with a bit of computational knowledge, I strongly encourage you to check out <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Code Academy</a> or <a href="http://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a>. Of all of Steve Jobs' various witty and insightful aphorisms, the notion that a computer is a <em>bicycle for the mind</em> has always struck me as especially apt.</p>
