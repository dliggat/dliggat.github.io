[Another][louisck] of Louis C.K.'s hilarious talk-show interview diatribes is being widely circulated on the web and Twitter right now - this time about smartphones, and why he won't let his children have one. It's well worth a watch, but his argument essentially boils down to the observation that smartphones provide a constant stream of distraction that removes the condition, boredom, that is arguably necessary for healthy self-reflection.<!--more-->

Humour aside, I think he's really onto something here. Speaking personally, boredom, at least how I understood the term pre-Internet, has essentially disappeared from my life. Very few of my waking hours are spent without mental stimulation of one form or another. If I'm waiting in a lineup, on public transport, unable to sleep, or killing time in an airport - out comes my phone, and the usual suspects [Tweetbot][tweetbot] or [Instapaper][instapaper] will occupy me for the duration of that transitory event. Even when I'm cooking, cycling, exercising, or walking the dog, I'm spared from any possible exposure to boredom through a now-years-old tendency to listen to podcasts[^1] or audiobooks whenever my hands are occupied.

As a technophile and enthusiast-for-non-boredom, it's hard for me to know how I should feel about this state of affairs. It's fairly easy to reason that since happiness may only exist in a world with sadness, then perhaps excitement and boredom share a similar, inextricable, symbiosis? I certainly don't currently *feel* like my life: work, personal or otherwise, lacks excitement - far from it. But this is 2013 - what about 2033 when we have *{insert your favourite prediction about technology two decades out[^2]}*?

Kids born in the recent past seem to be genuinely puzzled when they encounter a display which is not touch-sensitive, and I find it likely that this will be their response at the very notion of boredom as a concept in the years to come. I feel privileged to have grown up during that big epoch-defining[^3] transition from pre-Internet to our now permanent state of connectedness. I have vivid memories of what it was like to have only four TV channels and a few toys and books as the sole available vehicles for entertainment; and still more vivid memories of the initial realizations that I now had the power to answer virtually any question I could conceive of with just a few keystrokes.

I don't think the significance of this shift has been truly internalized by many people yet. Other than Louis C.K., of course.

[^1]: I love podcasts, but my subscriptions have grown well beyond the point of my ability to actually listen to them all.
[^2]: Visible screens inscribed on contact lenses?
[^3]: I am convinced that historians will have a well-defined name for this period in decades/centuries to come.
