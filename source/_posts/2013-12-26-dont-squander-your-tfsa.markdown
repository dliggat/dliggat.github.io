Since 2009, Canadians have been afforded a tax shelter called a TFSA. Most squander this opportunity.<!--more-->

Though not well understood, the basic TFSA concept is actually very simple.

1. Each year, Canadian adults may contribute `$Amount` to a TFSA account (In 2013, `$Amount` = $5,500)[^1].
2. The contribution is made using after-tax income (regular money, in other words - the same kind used to buy everything else).
3. Any financial gain resulting from such a contribution, from that point forward - whether in the form of interest, capital gains, or dividends - is not subject to tax. Ever.
4. You can withdraw monies from a TFSA at any time, but cannot, in general, put that back into the TFSA in the same calendar year without facing a stiff penalty (So don't do it! Wait until January 1st)[^2].

Two **misconceptions** seem to persist about TFSAs:

* **They can only be used for regular, plain-jane 'savings' accounts**. If you use it for this - you're almost certainly squandering the opportunity. There are many things one might deploy 'long-term tax-free growth' for, but savings accounts which usually undershoot the basic rate of inflation.
* **A TFSA is a special product offered by the bank**. It really isn't. It's nothing more than a regular account with the potential for financial gain (into which might go cash savings, or a GIC, or mutual funds, or ETFs or even stocks) with special tax treatment.

[^1]: The yearly contribution was initially set as **$5,000 in 2009 dollars** (inflation adjusted, and rounded to the nearest $500). That accounts for the jump to $5,500 in 2013, and it will likely rise to $6,000 in the 2016-2018 timeframe.
[^2]: This part is the hardest to comprehend, and carries the largest cost of failure. If I ever need to perform withdrawals (for instance - even changing accounts or moving to a new bank), I tend to wait until late December to do so, and then re-contribute after January 1st.
