I'm posting the following chart from [BCA Research](http://blog.bcaresearch.com/canadian-housing-the-bubble-debate) not for the purposes of persuasion, but rather, for posterity.<!--more-->

If you have a sense of the historical economic similarity between Canada and the United States, understand the computation and significance of `price:rent` and `price:income` as housing valuation metrics, and yet still don't feel *even a flutter of anxiety* about the future of the Canadian housing market, and more importantly, the downstream economic and societal implications of a [reversion to the mean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean) - then you're far beyond the power of my rhetoric to change your mind[^1].

As I write this, in late 2013, [Deutsche Bank][db] joins a growing list of spectators whose ranks include [The Economist][econ], [Goldman-Sachs][gs], [Robert Shiller][rs], the [IMF][imf], [Nouriel Roubini][nr], and [Paul Krugman][pk] - all of whom have expressed incredulity and/or concern in one form or another about the stratospheric valuations in the Canadian housing market.

My opinion, irrelevant and disinterested[^2] though it may be, is very straightforward, and has been unchanged for several years now: **this will end badly**, for the [leveraged][leveraged] and unleveraged, alike. Just ask anyone from the Republic of Ireland. Or look a little closer to home - below the 49th Parallel.

Feel free to disagree with me[^3]. Most Canadians do, at least as a default position. But if you do disagree, surely it's at least partially concerning to witness all this opposing consensus among weighty, if not necessarily clairvoyant, external parties?

[^1]: Or, quite possibly, you're subject to the phenomenon, originally noted by Upton Sinclair, that *it is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it*.
[^2]: I really mean this - I'm [disinterested](http://www.dailywritingtips.com/disinterested-not-the-same-as-uninterested) (but not *uninterested* clearly, as all of this is deeply fascinating to me - in a train-wreck sort of way). I have no real stake in whether or not there's a massive housing bubble in Canada, other than the stake of preferring not to live in a country captured by the fallacious belief that trading real estate is the preeminent way to generate wealth.
[^3]: Keep in mind: it's possible to simultaneously {own property | need to buy it soon} and {find the status quo very concerning}.
