description: How my iPhone home screen looks pre-iOS7.

iOS 7[^1] and a new iPhone are imminent. <!--more--> Tomorrow is Apple Christmas Morning.

It's the end of the road for [you][4s], my old friend.

[^1]: I fully expect this screenshot to look hilariously out of date once iOS 7 is rolled out everywhere and the new aesthetic is 'normal' and not at all novel. I won't miss stitched leather one bit.
