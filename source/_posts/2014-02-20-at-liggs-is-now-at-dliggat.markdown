I've changed my Twitter handle from @liggs to [@dliggat](https://twitter.com/dliggat), as part of a general username consolidation that's been nagging me for a while. I figured it was worth marking the *occasion* with a site entry, given how much I use Twitter.

In case you're wondering, it's quite easy to swap two Twitter handles with a [3-way switch][three], so long as you control both handles.

1. In one browser, I opened **@dliggat** to https://twitter.com/settings/account
2. In a seperate browser (Chrome instead of Safari in my case, but a [private browser][priv] session would work also) I also opened **@liggs** to https://twitter.com/settings/account
3. I renamed **@dliggat** to *@dliggattemp*. Once this is confirmed, the next two steps need to be completed as quickly as possible.
4. I renamed **@liggs** to **@dliggat**.
5. I renamed *@dliggattemp* to **@liggs**.

It all worked out without a hitch. [@dliggat](https://twitter.com/dliggat) it is from now on.
