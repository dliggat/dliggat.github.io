<!-- I never really bought into the whole ["Getting Things Done"][gtd] craze that was at the height of its vogue on the internet a few years ago. I accept that it works great for lots of people, but I tried it and it just wasn't for me. It imposes a rigidity of work-style that doesn't really mesh with the way I operate. Moreover, I don't think the existing tools have handled the transition to mobile all that well, and seem to presume a world where computation and communication are tethered to a desk someplace, and not immediately accessible and portable. -->

At the risk of outing myself as some sort of enormous nerd[^1] - I have an enduring fascination with the field of apps and processes that one can use to reduce the cognitive overhead of actually remembering and executing on the set of tasks that each of us must manage. I've tried every to-do list app and system under the sun, from [remember the milk][rtm] to [clear][clear] to [todo.txt][todotxt]. Mostly, I abandon these pretty shortly after starting; they all seem great on the surface, but I usually discover one reason or another that they are not a good fit for actually making me more productive. It's a deceptively complex problem space.

However, it occurred to me recently that my continual latent dissatisfaction with whatever my current setup happens to be... is missing right now. It might just be that I've managed to finally hone in on the perfect system (for me). There's no one single app that can form the centrepiece of what I want to achieve - but that's actually a feature, not a bug. Without further ado:
