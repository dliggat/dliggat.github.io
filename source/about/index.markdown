# About
My name is Dave Liggat; I'm an independent software engineer who works on web applications and their infrastructure, often with a strong *data science*[^1] leaning.

I've worked in software for over a decade, within all manner of organizations from startups through several Fortune-500 companies, in various technology stacks/environments including [C++][cpp], [Python][python][^2], and [ASP.NET][asp], but these days I'm primarily focused on full-stack web application development with [Ruby on Rails][ror], [JavaScript][js], and [Amazon Web Services][aws]. My educational background is in Computer Science & Mathematics; along the way I did a Masters degree in [Operations Research][or].

Contact/consulting details can be found [here](/contact).

## Why Does this Site Exist?
Primarily - as a creative outlet. I've always enjoyed writing, and I like the opportunity for permanence that the web provides. Also, it's fascinating to me to get insight into my past personality and interests - so I post things here (and on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dliggat)) of current interest knowing that I'm basically queuing up future introspection for myself. I primarily write about topics in the sphere of technology and occasionally finance.

I believe it is important to own your own identity and content online, especially if you work in tech. This makes a highly-portable, statically-generated website[^3] very appealing for long-form writing versus one of the various social platforms, which I have no particular confidence will still exist in a decade.

[^1]: I won't go so far as to call myself a *data scientist* – I lack the seemingly-requisite Ph.D. for one thing – but the projects I work on tend to be very data-centric - whether in analysis, modeling, visualization, etc.
[^2]: A side-effect of [Xooglerdom](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/14/the-xoogler-diaspora/?_r=0) is an enduring affection for Python.
