# About
My name is Dave Liggat; I'm an independent software engineer with a strong focus on Ruby on Rails, Data Analytics and Web & Analytics Infrastructure (and, once in a while, ASP.NET). Opinions are my own. Contact details [here](/contact).

## Why Does this Site Exist?
Primarily - as a creative outlet. I've always enjoyed writing, and I like the opportunity for permanence that the web provides. Also, it's fascinating to me to get insight into my past personality and interests - so I post things here (and on Twitter) of current interest knowing that I'm basically queuing up future entertainment & reflection for myself.

I believe it is important to own your own identity and content online, especially if you work in tech. This makes [Octopress](http://octopress.org) + portable-hosting very appealing for long-form writing versus one of the various social platforms, which I have no particular confidence will still exist in a decade.

As a bonus, Octopress is an interesting and highly-configurable technology playground, and a good way for me, as a server/data/analytics guy, to get some healthy ongoing exposure to web front-end technologies.
