# About
My name is Dave Liggat; I'm an independent software engineer who works on web applications and their infrastructure, often with a data analytics/visualization leaning. I've worked in software for over a decade, in various technology stacks/environments including .NET, ASP.NET, C++, and Python, but these days I'm primarily focused on Ruby on Rails and JavaScript. My educational background is in Computer Science & Mathematics; along the way I did a Masters degree in [Operations Research](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research).

Contact/consulting details can be found [here](/contact).

## Why Does this Site Exist?
Primarily - as a creative outlet. I've always enjoyed writing, and I like the opportunity for permanence that the web provides. Also, it's fascinating to me to get insight into my past personality and interests - so I post things here (and on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dliggat)) of current interest knowing that I'm basically queuing up future entertainment & reflection for myself. I primarily write about topics in the sphere of technology and occasionally finance.

I believe it is important to own your own identity and content online, especially if you work in tech. This makes a highly-portable, statically-generated website[^1] very appealing for long-form writing versus one of the various social platforms, which I have no particular confidence will still exist in a decade.
